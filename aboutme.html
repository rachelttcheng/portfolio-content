	<p>I am a 20 year old computer science major at the University of Michigan. I was always a pretty active kid:
		I did ballet for over 10 years, volleyball for over 4 years, and even won second place at a ping pong tournament once.
		As is the story of many college-goers, all of this physical activity pretty much completely stopped when I came to college.
		I went to the gym occasionally to run on the treadmill and also did Chloe Ting workouts like everyone else when
		the COVID-19 pandemic started. I didn't seriously get into weight training until April 2021 when I tagged along for 
		a full 3-day workout split with one of my friends (thanks Tim).

	<p>It helped a lot to go to the gym with someone else, and I've carried that philosophy with me since going regularly.
		I've taken a few of my friends to the gym to get them started on their own fitness journeys, etc etc write more here
	</p>

	<p>Aside from weight training, I also love going on hikes with my mom. I'm very fortunate to be from the Bay Area in 
		California (redwood trees galore!) - there are so many beautiful trails there.
